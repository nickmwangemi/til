Just thought it was a neat concept! Two web designers are given the same mood board and set of assets and are walked through it together. Then they have a time limit -- I think 30 minutes -- to design something. The one I watched was for a burger restaurant and the designers seemed to have a lot of fun with it. They also had very different approaches which, as a backend personl, was fun to watch. 

Kind of made me want to see something similar for backend design. Like given a set of requirements, a cookiecutter repo, and maybe an API or existing dataset, take 30 minutes and build the closest thing to an MVP to solve this problem that you can.

- [Brother Downloads Page](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hl2270dw_all): Has the drivers and stuff, but supported Mac OS only goes up to 10.15 and I am on 13.something.

## 3-6-23 

- Confirmed that it can print a test page 
- Did a reset to factory settings 
- Deleted the printer from my laptop, planning to uninstall and reinstall it  
- Downloaded the drivers from the interet but couldn't get them to work as described in the docs 
- I made a mistake and closed my tabs before I could record all the docs I consulted 
- Assumption: It is complicated to use this printer with a Google mesh system 
- Fixing it might involve hooking up the printer to the internet via an ethernet cable to make the wireless capability work 
- Could not get the driver installation to match the picture -- Am not even sure it is installed? 
- Laptop seems to think it's installed, but is also unwilling to print from it 
- Also tried connecting the USB cable and printing directly through that, but that resulted in all of the lights coming on and I couldn't move forward. 
- I'm tapped out.

And it seems to think a driver is installed, although the printer did rename itself "-maintenance" and I don't know why

This is what I could not get to work:

I also never had any screen that looked like this:

These exist. Also, Drivers was there but it went away when I installed it.

### Current status

- All 4 lights are on 
- The printer "exists" to the laptop (see screenshots above) but if I try to access it, it is not accessible.

### What next? 

- [ ] Skip the laptop and see if I can do this process from my phone 
- [ ] Dig up an ethernet cable and see if I can get it to work that way 
- [ ] Uninstall the drivers and downloads and see what happens 
- [ ] Google how to fully uninstall a printer to make sure I did that part right. 
- [ ] Go get the big photo printer and see if I can get that to work 
- [ ] Consider just buying a new printer? This one is about eight years old. But it's actually a really easy printer... once it's hooked up. But Lord help you if you ever need to change anything, apparently.

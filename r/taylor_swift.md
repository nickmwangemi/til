# `taylor`: The Taylor Swift / R Project 

_This readme was generated by ChatGPT and edited/proofread by me._ 

[`taylor`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/) is an R package that provides a huge trove of data about Taylor Swift's song lyrics.The analysis is based on version 2.0.0 of the package, and its datasets are as current as possible and include content from the Eras tour. .

The goal of this project is to explore Taylor Swift's discography and gain insights into her music, lyrics, and album themes using the data provided by the `taylor` R package.

## Features

The taylor package provides several datasets:

`taylor_all_songs`: A data set containing lyrics to and characteristics of all officially released Taylor Swift songs. This includes albums, EPs, and individually released singles.
`taylor_album_songs`: Same as `taylor_all_songs` but fewer songs -- one for each song from an official studio album 
`taylor_albums`: A data set containing the names of Taylor's official releases, the album type, and release date.
